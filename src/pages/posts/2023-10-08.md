# Hooray, we did it
First post but not much for words at the moment. It's very bare in terms of features but functional.
I've been interested in lightweight blogs for some time now and thought this would be a good opportunity to as a project to use a framework and get more familiar to Markdown.
This is built on Astro, I was initially interested at the advertised fast turn around to develop and deploy and kind of just dove straight into it. Along with using Tailwind, the development process was a lot faster than I thought. Tailwind helped so much, I've really been enjoying this framework. 

## Still much to accomplish for this blog
As stated: functional, but bare.

### Desktop still is next to be developed
So desktop is definitely in progress. In the meantime while desktop is in the works I capped the maximum width to around 800px.

### Make things look prettier
It's starting to look pretty, but not actually pretty. Also kind of feeling like I've been using mountains too much as banners. Layout is pretty much finished but the individual pages and the design language is something I haven't really decided. 

### Organizing my posts and collections
I'm not quite sure if naming my posts by date is the best way to go. I have to look into perhaps a better way of organizing the markdown. Astro has a collections feature that seems promising, being able to work these collections in the code such as the usage of tags.

### Stay with Astro?
Working ith Astro has been a pleasure. 
That being said, I want to look further into server side rendering vs client side rendering.
