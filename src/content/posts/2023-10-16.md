In my latest blog post, I've encountered a few challenges with formatting using Markdown and frontmatter. While code snippets are working seamlessly, I've had to find a workaround for headings and paragraph formatting.

# Addressing Headings

For headings, the issue seemed to be with the default Markdown styling. To resolve this, I turned to embedded HTML elements with inline styles right on the Markdown page. For instance:

```html
<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">Now I am a true heading</h1>
```

This allowed me to create properly formatted headings while preserving the structure of my content. However, I understand the desire to minimize the entanglement of HTML with Markdown.

# Dealing with Paragraphs

Another peculiar issue I faced was the lack of smooth paragraph formatting with line breaks. At the moment, I'm creating new paragraphs by adding a backslash at the end of each line:

```markdown
... writing writing writing.
<br/>
<br/>
New paragraph new paragraph...
```

This method works for now, but I'm exploring ways to maintain the clean separation of content and presentation without relying too heavily on inline HTML.

While the general layout of my post is now in place, I'm eager to find a more elegant solution that doesn't require extensive HTML within the Markdown content. Balancing readability and presentation is key, and I'm excited to continue my exploration in this area.

I hope this revised version of your post sounds smoother and addresses your concerns. If you have any further revisions or specific questions, please let me know!
