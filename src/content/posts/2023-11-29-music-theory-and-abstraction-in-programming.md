# What is an abstraction?

This is often a term that's thrown around a lot in programming articles and discussions. The typical definition usually goes something along the lines of hiding information and creating generalizations. I didn't really understand this definition because it entangles itself with encapsulation, which also involves hiding information. So for a good amount of time, my understanding of abstraction was basically encapsulation, just hiding information. And if it's the case, then why? Why "hide" information? These are questions that I eventually found some sort of answer to, but for this post I want to share my thoughts on the concept. It's a pretty interesting concept outside of programming because there is a level of practicality to it.

## Music Theory and the Guitar

To outline the premise of this post, this is a bit of background information.

Music theory and applying it on the guitar is a bit of a difficult undertaking. A sound is created when we press down onto a fret and pluck the string. Pretty simple. However, once we get to learning note names, of which there are 12 in western music, it starts to get pretty hairy because the guitar has six strings and the amount of frets available. Meaning one note can have six diffrent locations (It's actually more because a typicaly guitar can have 21 to 24 frets). So assuming we have 24 frets with six strings, a guitarist would have to internalize 144 individual frets and their names. What makes learning and memorizing the notes on a guitar difficult is that the notes all look the same, the only diffrent is that it's a different fret or a different string. On a different instrument like the piano, each different note has a distinct physical key, even the natural notes (notes that are not flat or sharp) have a different shape from one another. On the guitar, whether the note is a natural or has a flat or sharp it's just a fret. Imagine spending the first half of the year just learning the fretboard in its entirety. It's maddening!

So then what about music theory? Learning the principles regarding what makes a chord, what creates harmony, what is a key signature? Learning these principles on paper away from an instrument is relatively straight forward. It's almost logical to a degree. However, from my own experience I had a difficult time applying what I know to my instrument, the interface I used to create sound, my guitar because I still had not internalized the note names and locations on the instrument.

And that's typically the large challenge that guitarists face: either learn the notes or don't.

Most people choose not to learn the notes of the instrument at all. In fact, out the people that play instruments, it's a high probabilty that people that play guitar don't know how to process the notes on their instruments. However, they do utilize some form of theory. It may not be comprehensize, but it's usable.
