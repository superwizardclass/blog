# The premise of this post

This is a blog where I post mostly about programming. And that's true, programming is a rather large part of my life, I even attended and graduated from a place that provided training to be a developer, so I enjoy reading and writing about small topics regarding programming. I think reading and having access the amount of knowledge for developers is a large part of why I enjoy programming and its auxiliary topics. Another huge part of my life is music, well rather guitar. Just like programming I enjoy consuming all topcs regarding guitar, however there's one rather large difference between the two topics is that I have very poor understanding of the language of music, also known as music theory. I can tell you what dependency injection is and why it could be useful, but I couldn't provide an answer to something basic like the chord tones of let's say a B major chord (hint: it's B D# F#). So as much as I wanted to read about music and dive deeper into musical content such as why my favourite guitarists sound like they do or what to play over a dominant chord, the reality was that I couldn't, for two simple problems:

1. I didn't know music theory well enough
2. I didn't know the notes of my instrument well enough

It's a bit of an interesting position to be able to play guitar at a reasonable skill, but also have no idea what is being played and not being able to analyze it. Millions of guitarists have had tremondous success in playing their instrument without any theory, but personally I wasn't very happy knowing that I could be better. So, for 2023 my goals for guitar were:

1. Get comfortable reading music
2. Learn and internalize all the notes on the fretboard

## When the Fretboard Meets the Theory

Learning the fretboard was a pretty large undertaking. The notes on the fretboard virtually look the same as another note so
